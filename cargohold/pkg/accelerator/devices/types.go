// TritonGPUInfo holds key GPU fields relevant to Triton cache validation
// It now supports both NVIDIA (CUDA) and AMD (ROCm) GPUs.
type TritonGPUInfo struct {
	// Name represents the model name of the GPU (e.g., "Tesla V100", "RTX 3090", "Radeon RX 6900 XT").
	// This field is universal for all GPUs.
	Name string

	// UUID represents the unique identifier of the GPU, useful for distinguishing multiple GPUs.
	// This field is also universal.
	UUID string

	// ComputeCapability reflects the GPU's compute capability. For CUDA GPUs, it's a string
	// (e.g., "6.1" for Volta), while for ROCm GPUs, it might be represented by a version number
	// or a similar capability specifier. It could be used to identify supported instruction sets
	// and hardware features.
	ComputeCapability string

	// Arch is a numerical representation of the GPU's architecture. For CUDA GPUs, it's a specific
	// number (e.g., 60 for Maxwell, 70 for Volta), while ROCm might have a different notation
	// (e.g., "gfx906" for Vega GPUs).
	Arch string

	// WarpSize reflects the number of threads in a single warp on the GPU.
	// This field would be applicable to CUDA GPUs (usually 32 threads per warp), but might be
	// handled differently in ROCm, as AMD uses wavefronts, which might not have a direct one-to-one mapping.
	WarpSize int

	// MemoryTotalMB represents the total amount of memory available on the GPU in megabytes.
	// This is common for both NVIDIA and AMD GPUs.
	MemoryTotalMB uint64

	// PTXVersion indicates the PTX version used for NVIDIA CUDA GPUs.
	// For ROCm, this would be replaced with a similar field for the intermediate language (e.g., HIP).
	PTXVersion int

	Backend string
